 Validation attributes are a way to configure model validation 
 so it’s similar conceptually to validation on fields in database tables. 
 This includes constraints such as assigning data types or required fields. 
 Other types of validation include applying patterns to data to enforce business rules, 
 such as a credit card, phone number, or email address. Validation attributes make enforcing 
 these requirements much simpler and easier to use.

Simply reading through the model reveals the rules about data for this app, making 
it easier to maintain the code. Below are several popular built-in validation attributes:

[CreditCard]: Validates the property has a credit card format.
[Compare]: Validates two properties in a model match.
[EmailAddress]: Validates the property has an email format.
[Phone]: Validates the property has a telephone format.
[Range]: Validates the property value falls within the given range.
[RegularExpression]: Validates that the data matches the specified regular expression.
[Required]: Makes a property required.
[StringLength]: Validates that a string property has at most the given maximum length.
[Url]: Validates the property has a URL format.

MVC supports any attribute that derives from ValidationAttribute for validation purposes. 
Many useful validation attributes can be found in the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace.

There may be instances where you need more features than built-in attributes provide. 
For those times, you can create custom validation attributes by deriving from ValidationAttribute or 
changing your model to implement IValidatableObject.

Model State
Model state represents validation errors in submitted HTML form values.
MVC will continue validating fields until reaches the maximum number of errors (200 by default). 
You can configure this number by inserting the following code into the ConfigureServices method in the Startup.cs file:

services.AddMvc(options => options.MaxModelValidationErrors = 50);

Manual validation
After model binding and validation are complete, 
you may want to repeat parts of it. For example, a user may have entered text in a field expecting an integer, 
or you may need to compute a value for a model’s property.
You may need to run validation manually. To do so, call the TryValidateModel method, as shown here:
TryValidateModel(movie);
     */
public class Movie
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [StringLength(100)]
    public string Title { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [ClassicMovie(1960)]
    [DataType(DataType.Date)]
    public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [StringLength(1000)]
    public string Description { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [Range(0, 999.99)]
    public decimal Price { get; set; }

    [Required]
    public Genre Genre { get; set; }

    public bool Preorder { get; set; }
}

/*
Creating your own custom validation attributes in MVC is easy. 
Just inherit from the ValidationAttribute, and override the IsValid method. 
The IsValid method accepts two parameters, the first is an object named value and 
the second is a ValidationContext object named validationContext. Value refers to 
the actual value from the field that your custom validator is validating.

In the following sample, a business rule states that users may not set the genre to Classic 
for a movie released after 1960. The [ClassicMovie] attribute checks the genre first, and if 
it is a classic, then it checks the release date to see that it is later than 1960. If it is 
released after 1960, validation fails. The attribute accepts an integer parameter representing the
year that you can use to validate data. You can capture the value of the parameter in the attribute’s 
constructor, as shown here: 
     */

public class ClassicMovieAttribute : ValidationAttribute, IClientModelValidator
{
    private int _year;

    public ClassicMovieAttribute(int Year)
    {
        _year = Year;
    }

    public void AddValidation(ClientModelValidationContext context)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    protected override ValidationResult IsValid(object value, ValidationContext validationContext)
    {
        Movie movie = (Movie)validationContext.ObjectInstance;

        if (movie.Genre == Genre.Classic && movie.ReleaseDate.Year > _year)
        {
            return new ValidationResult("ERORORORO");
        }

        return ValidationResult.Success;
    }
    /*
    The movie variable above represents a Movie object that contains the data from the form submission to validate. 
    In this case, the validation code checks the date and genre in the IsValid method of the ClassicMovieAttribute 
    class as per the rules. Upon successful validation IsValid returns a ValidationResult.Success code, and when 
    validation fails, a ValidationResult with an error message. When a user modifies the Genre field and submits 
    the form, the IsValid method of the ClassicMovieAttribute will verify whether the movie is a classic. Like 
    any built-in attribute, apply the ClassicMovieAttribute to a property such as ReleaseDate to ensure validation 
    happens, as shown in the previous code sample. Since the example works only with Movie types, a better option 
    is to use IValidatableObject as shown in the following paragraph.

Alternatively, this same code could be placed in the model by implementing the Validate method on the 
IValidatableObject interface. While custom validation attributes work well for validating individual properties, 
implementing IValidatableObject can be used to implement class-level validation as seen here.

public IEnumerable<ValidationResult> Validate(ValidationContext validationContext)
{
    if (Genre == Genre.Classic && ReleaseDate.Year > _classicYear)
    {
        yield return new ValidationResult(
            "Classic movies must have a release year earlier than " + _classicYear,
            new[] { "ReleaseDate" });
    }
} 
         */

    public class Genre
    {
        internal static Genre Classic;
    }
}

/*
Client side validation is a great convenience for users. It saves time they would otherwise spend waiting 
for a round trip to the server. In business terms, even a few fractions of seconds multiplied hundreds of 
times each day adds up to be a lot of time, expense, and frustration. Straightforward and immediate validation 
enables users to work more efficiently and produce better quality input and output.

MVC uses validation attributes in addition to type metadata from model properties to validate data and display 
any error messages using JavaScript. When you use MVC to render form elements from a model using Tag Helpers or 
HTML helpers it will add HTML 5 data- attributes in the form elements that need validation, as shown below. 
MVC generates the data- attributes for both built-in and custom attributes. You can display validation errors 
on the client using the relevant tag helpers as shown here:

<div class="form-group">
    <label asp-for="ReleaseDate" class="col-md-2 control-label"></label>
    <div class="col-md-10">
        <input asp-for="ReleaseDate" class="form-control" />
        <span asp-validation-for="ReleaseDate" class="text-danger"></span>
    </div>
</div>

The tag helpers above render the HTML below. 
Notice that the data- attributes in the HTML output correspond to the validation attributes for the ReleaseDate 
property. The data-val-required attribute below contains an error message to display if the
user doesn’t fill in the release date field, and that message displays in the accompanying <span> element.

<form action="/movies/Create" method="post">
  <div class="form-horizontal">
    <h4>Movie</h4>
    <div class="text-danger"></div>
    <div class="form-group">
      <label class="col-md-2 control-label" for="ReleaseDate">ReleaseDate</label>
      <div class="col-md-10">
        <input class="form-control" type="datetime"
        data-val="true" data-val-required="The ReleaseDate field is required."
        id="ReleaseDate" name="ReleaseDate" value="" />
        <span class="text-danger field-validation-valid"
        data-valmsg-for="ReleaseDate" data-valmsg-replace="true"></span>
      </div>
    </div>
    </div>
</form>

Client-side validation prevents submission until the form is valid. 
The Submit button runs JavaScript that either submits the form or displays error messages.
MVC determines type attribute values based on the .NET data type of a property, 
possibly overridden using [DataType] attributes. The base [DataType] attribute does no real server-side validation. 
Browsers choose their own error messages and display those errors however they wish, however the 
jQuery Validation Unobtrusive package can override the messages and display them consistently with others. 
This happens most obviously when users apply [DataType] subclasses such as [EmailAddress]

IClientModelValidator

You may create client side logic for your custom attribute, and unobtrusive validation will execute 
it on the client for you automatically as part of validation. The first step is to control what data- attributes 
are added by implementing the IClientModelValidator interface as shown here:

public void AddValidation(ClientModelValidationContext context)
{
    if (context == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));
    }

    MergeAttribute(context.Attributes, "data-val", "true");
    MergeAttribute(context.Attributes, "data-val-classicmovie", GetErrorMessage());

    var year = _year.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
    MergeAttribute(context.Attributes, "data-val-classicmovie-year", year);
}
Attributes that implement this interface can add HTML attributes to generated fields. 
Examining the output for the ReleaseDate element reveals HTML that is similar to the previous example, 
except now there is a data-val-classicmovie attribute that was defined in the AddValidation method of 
IClientModelValidator.

<input class="form-control" type="datetime"
data-val="true"
data-val-classicmovie="Classic movies must have a release year earlier than 1960"
data-val-classicmovie-year="1960"
data-val-required="The ReleaseDate field is required."
id="ReleaseDate" name="ReleaseDate" value="" />
Unobtrusive validation uses the data in the data- attributes to display error messages. 
However, jQuery doesn’t know about rules or messages until you add them to jQuery’s validator object. 
This is shown in the example below that adds a method named classicmovie containing custom client validation 
code to the jQuery validator object.

$(function () {
    jQuery.validator.addMethod('classicmovie',
        function (value, element, params) {
            // Get element value. Classic genre has value '0'.
            var genre = $(params[0]).val(),
                year = params[1],
                date = new Date(value);
            if (genre && genre.length > 0 && genre[0] === '0') {
                // Since this is a classic movie, invalid if release date is after given year.
                return date.getFullYear() <= year;
            }

            return true;
        });

    jQuery.validator.unobtrusive.adapters.add('classicmovie',
        [ 'element', 'year' ],
        function (options) {
            var element = $(options.form).find('select#Genre')[0];
            options.rules['classicmovie'] = [element, parseInt(options.params['year'])];
            options.messages['classicmovie'] = options.message;
        });
}(jQuery));
Now jQuery has the information to execute the custom JavaScript validation as well as the error message 
to display if that validation code returns false.
